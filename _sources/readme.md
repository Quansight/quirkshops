# Quirkshops

Quirkshops are a Quansight program for incubating diverse and inclusive community events that tend toward experimental interactive multimedia formats. This program is inspired by our unique international positions as respected leaders in open source community and culture. The Quansight halls are filled with a rich culture of caring talented people, and quirkshops document their collective impacts.

# community is a skill

Quansight is a community of talented and caring people working to improve open source collaborations and literacies. Code is just a substrate for many of us that identify with open software communities. In this quirkshop we'll hear from community members of popular scientific computing projects like numpy, scikit-learn, spyder, jupyter, and pytorch. They'll share their motivation and goals with their software communities alongside specific programs that run to encouragement community growth.

During this quirkshop we want to explore the heart of open source, the community. We will have four guests and a host telling us how do they contribute to their communities.

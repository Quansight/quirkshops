# Quansight Quirkshops

Quirkshops are skill share events, not tech share showcase events. 
Quansight Quirkshops focus on educational entertainment services on open source topics hosted by Quansight on Qhub.
The Quirkshop program has two different tracks (1) internal tracks focusing on professional enrichment for working in/with open source and (2) external tracks that are live streamed technical demonstrations 
of open source software.

Quirkshops are only possible because of the affordance of video chat directly in your Jupyter.
It allows for a different educational experience with Jupyter as a substrate for an entire event.

## Internal Quansight Quirkshops

We all love ending the week with tech share, it inspiring
to see the talented work Quansight consistently createds.
There is technical skill required work in open source
and we have the documentation for that.
Meanwhile, there are other abilities we can learn,
that lack documentation, to be more effective and empathetic
contributors to our communities.

Quansight Quirkshops start the week with focused discussions
on contemporary challenges we face in open source; for which
there is little to no documentation.
Each Quirkshops will be an hour-long, recorded skillshare
around the folk knowledge, we as an organization, have in open source.
These inclusive events, inspired by the jam session program,
promote discussion through presentation, demos, and critique
between the positions of consumers, producers, and stakeholders of open source software.

### Quirkshop topics

1. Hacking CSS: Making applications look the way you want, especially Jupyter.
2. Tone and meaning: Responding to open source issues and pull requests with a üòÉ and ü§ù,
3. Documentation about the documentation: A modern exploration of documentation tooling, integrations, and commmunity building.
4. Project productivity hacks: A survey of infrastructure on different projects for continuous integration.
5. Social media and software: do's and don'ts
6. The fine line between (demo)nstration and (demo)lition: some guidance for demos.
7. What's in a test? Things think about when writing your tests.

### Internal Quirkshops to Stress Test Qhub

Internal Quirkshops test Qhub under different educational constraints. This program has the ability to detect edge cases in Qhub before they are presented to the customer.

## External Qtv Webisodes

When working on a Qhub, it becomes a place where I can learn and share with friends.
There are vast applications of Qhub and generating documentation to satisfy all the possibilities
would be challenging. To supplement the documentation we present Qtv on Qhub, a weekly webisode that 
focuses on technical demonstrations and workshops of ideas for developers by developers. 
Each episode will have a curated Qhub environment with all the necessary packages to provide an immersive technical demonstration solely in Jupyter. These episodes can be used to highlight open source talent and contributions made by Quansight and friends.
